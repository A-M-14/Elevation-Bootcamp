<h1>My Personal Introduction</h1>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! My name is <strong>Assaf Mor</strong> and I'm a 3-rd year Computer Science student with a minor in <em>software Engineering</em>.<br>
    I skilled in C, C++, C# Java and Python with hands-on experience in designing and implementing software applications.<br>

  <h2>My Goals</h2>
  <p>
    My main goal is to become a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> who can build complete web applications from start to finish.<br>

    I believe that this certification, combined with a lot of practice, will contribute greatly to this.
