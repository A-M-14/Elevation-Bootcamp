        <h1>Responsive Navigation Example</h1>
    </header>

    <p>This is a simple layout example using CSS Flexbox. The header contains navigation links, and the main content area is flexible to accommodate different screen sizes.
    The navigation bar is styled with a hover effect, and the dropdown menu appears when you hover over the "Services" link. The footer remains at the bottom of the page.
    Add text here to see how the layout adapts to different content lengths. You can also resize the browser window to see the responsive behavior of the layout.
    Try hovering over the links to see the hover effect. The navigation bar is designed to be responsive, collapsing into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
